✅ **Passing tests**: Integration tests prove all 14 instructions work together
✅ **Clear scope**: AUDIT_REQUEST.md identifies exactly what needs review

## What Makes This Audit Different

### This is NOT a typical DeFi audit
- Not a trading protocol or yield farming (low mission impact)
- This is infrastructure for funding long-term research projects
- Auditors will appreciate the vision beyond just "make money faster"

### Security Focus is Unique
- Fund transfers must be properly gated (critical)
- Oracle consensus must be manipulation-proof (critical)
- Governance voting must prevent tyranny (important)
- Permanent archival must be immutable (important)

### Vision Alignment
The auditors will understand they're not just reviewing code—they're verifying the foundations for funding humanity's future. That's worth $25K investment.
