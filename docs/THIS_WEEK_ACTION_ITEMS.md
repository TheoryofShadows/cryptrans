## Talking Points (If They Ask Questions)

**"What is CrypTrans?"**
> "It's a decentralized DAO for funding long-term transhuman research projects through permanent governance voting and oracle verification. Think: immutable ledger for humanity's future."

**"Why does this matter?"**
> "We're building infrastructure to fund consciousness revival research and other transhuman futures. The security of the fund release mechanism is critical."

**"How urgent is this?"**
> "We want to launch on Solana Mainnet-Beta immediately after audit passes. This is blocking our mainnet deployment."

**"What should we focus on?"**
> "Fund transfer security (CPI safety), oracle consensus (can it be manipulated?), and voting system (supermajority enforcement). See AUDIT_REQUEST.md for detailed focus areas."
