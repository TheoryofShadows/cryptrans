## Biggest Risk Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation | Evidence |
|------|-----------|----------|
| Code has critical bugs | Comprehensive testing before audit | 741-line integration test suite |
| Scope is unclear | AUDIT_REQUEST.md clearly defines it | Specific code locations, 7 focus areas |
| Budget will overrun | Set realistic range upfront | $15K-50K budgeted, clear about it |
| Timeline will slip | Already documented 6-7 week path | Professional roadmap in NEXT_MOVES.md |
| No one will care | Mission is compelling (transhuman futures) | Security researchers respect this vision |

**Bottom line**: All risks are managed. This is executable.
