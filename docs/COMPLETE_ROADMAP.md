|------|-----------|-------|
| Smart contract bugs | Professional security audit | Trail of Bits |
| Frontend bugs | Devnet testing, QA | Dev team |
| Mainnet issues | Conservative deployment | Dev team |
| Scalability limits | Load testing | Monitoring team |

### Community Risks
| Risk | Mitigation | Owner |
|------|-----------|-------|
| Low adoption | Strong marketing | Marketing team |
| Spam proposals | PoW difficulty gating | Smart contract |
| Oracle collusion | 3+ oracle quorum | System design |
| Whale control | Demurrage decay | System design |

### Market Risks
| Risk | Mitigation | Owner |
|------|-----------|-------|
| Bear market | Mission-focused, not hype | Community |

## Critical Path

The fastest path to mainnet launch:

```
TODAY (Week 1):
✅ Contact audit firms
✅ All documentation complete
✅ CLI complete
✅ Discord ready

Week 2-4:
✅ Audit in progress
✅ Community building
✅ Frontend development

Week 5:
✅ Audit findings
✅ Implement fixes

Week 6:
✅ Final approval

Week 7:
✅ MAINNET LAUNCH

Week 10:

```

**Critical dependencies** (can't parallelize):
- Must complete audit before mainnet
- Must pass devnet testing before mainnet
- Must fix any audit findings

**Can parallelize**:
- Audit + community building
- Audit + frontend development
- Audit + marketing
- Devnet testing + first project identification
