# What's Next - Immediate Action Plan

**Status**: All infrastructure complete ✅
**Next Phase**: Contact security auditors
**Timeline**: This week (TODAY through Friday)
**Critical Path Item**: This blocks mainnet launch

---

## The One Thing You Need to Do This Week

### Contact 3 Professional Security Audit Firms

Send audit requests to:
1. **Trail of Bits** (first choice - best reputation)
2. **Kudelski Security** (second choice - top tier)
3. **Immunefi** (third choice - more affordable)

**Why?** No code can launch on mainnet without professional security verification.

**Timeline**: Send TODAY/TOMORROW, get quotes by Friday, select firm by Friday EOD

---

## How to Do It (Step-by-Step)

## What Happens During the Audit (Weeks 2-4)

While the auditors review your code, you can:

### Parallel Activity 1: Community Building
- Launch Discord server (use guide in `MARKETING_STRATEGY.md`)
- Post on Twitter (use templates in same doc)
- Write Medium article (outline provided)
- Build email list (Substack free tier)

### Parallel Activity 2: Frontend Development
- Read `FRONTEND_SETUP_GUIDE.md`
- Set up React project
- Build wallet connection
- Implement voting interface
- Deploy to Vercel

### Parallel Activity 3: Content Creation
- Record YouTube tutorials
- Write blog posts
- Create social media graphics
- Reach out to influencers

**These don't delay audit, they happen simultaneously.**

---

## Success Criteria for This Week

✅ **Tuesday**: 3 audit firms contacted
✅ **Wednesday**: Initial responses received
✅ **Thursday**: Formal quotes arrived
✅ **Friday**: Firm selected and engagement confirmed

If all 3 ✅, you've successfully unblocked the path to mainnet.

---

## If a Firm Doesn't Respond

**Timeline**: Don't wait longer than Friday for each firm

**If no response by Thursday**:
1. Try their alternate contact method
2. Call their main number
3. Be direct: "We need a Solana smart contract audit"
4. Emphasize: "We have a clear scope and fair budget"

**If still no response by Friday**:
- Move on to next firm on list
- You'll likely have response from another firm

**Bottom line**: At least ONE firm will respond and quote.

---

## Evaluating Quotes (When They Arrive)

### Compare on These Criteria (in order)

**#1: Solana Experience** (Most Important)
- Have they audited Solana programs before?
- Do they understand PDA signers, CPI, Anchor?
- Can they provide references?

**#2: Timeline** (Critical)
- Can they start within 2-3 days?
- Will they complete in 2-3 weeks?
- What's their escalation process?

**#3: Team Quality** (Important)
- How many senior auditors assigned?
- What's their response time?
- Do they understand governance systems?

**#4: Report Quality** (Important)
- Will report be public or private?
- Detail level: executive summary + technical?
- Actionable recommendations?

**#5: Cost** (Important but #5)
- Is it reasonable? ($15K-50K is typical)
- No hidden fees?
- Payment terms flexible?

### Making Your Selection

**Pick Trail of Bits IF:**
- They respond with a reasonable quote
- They have strong Solana experience
- They can start soon
- (This is your best option if available)

**Otherwise Pick Kudelski IF:**
- They respond
- They have Solana experience
- Timeline works

**Otherwise Pick Immunefi IF:**
- You need to get started ASAP
- You want community auditors
- You prefer lower cost

**Important**: ANY of the three is acceptable. Pick whoever responds first with a reasonable quote.

---

## After You Select a Firm

### Day 1 (Friday)
- Confirm you want to proceed
- Agree on timeline
- Exchange basic contract terms

### Day 2-3 (Weekend/Monday)
- Firm completes any legal/admin
- You might need to sign audit agreement
- Firm might ask clarifying questions

### Day 4+ (Week 2)
- **Audit officially begins**
- You can start community building
- Developers start frontend work
- Marketing team starts content creation

---

## The Critical Path (What Can't Be Parallelized)

```
Week 1: Contact auditors → Receive quotes → Select firm
        ↓
Week 2-4: Audit in progress (can't speed up, can parallelize other work)
        ↓
Week 5: Audit findings → Plan fixes (must wait for audit)
        ↓
Week 6: Implement & fix → Re-test (must implement audit findings)
        ↓
Week 7: Deploy to mainnet (can't deploy without audit pass)
```

**Key insight**: The audit is on the critical path. Everything else can happen in parallel.

**Your job this week**: Start the audit clock ticking.

---

## What NOT to Do

❌ **Don't wait for perfect timing**
- Send audit requests TODAY/TOMORROW
- Sooner = faster mainnet launch

❌ **Don't over-negotiate price**
- Budget is $15K-50K
- That's market rate
- Getting audited is non-negotiable

❌ **Don't ask for custom features**
- Keep scope simple: "Review 14 instructions, focus on X, Y, Z"
- Audit scope is already defined in AUDIT_REQUEST.md

❌ **Don't hide anything**
- Auditors need full code access (it's on GitHub)
- Be transparent about any concerns
- Any bugs found now = fixed before mainnet

❌ **Don't panic if they find issues**
- Audits FIND issues (that's the point)
- Finding issues now = can't happen on mainnet
- This is the GOAL of the audit

## If You Have Questions Before Sending Emails

### Question: "How do I know these are legitimate firms?"

**Answer**: They're the most trusted blockchain auditors in the industry.

- **Trail of Bits**: Founded 2012, audited 100+ smart contracts
- **Kudelski Security**: Founded 1994, top-tier security firm
- **Immunefi**: Founded 2020, community-driven audit platform

All have public portfolios of past audits.

### Question: "What if they say no?"

**Answer**: They won't. Your project is:
- Clear scope (14 instructions)
- Fair budget ($15K-50K)
- Realistic timeline (2-3 weeks)
- Important mission (transhuman futures)

They'll want to work with you.

### Question: "What if the audit finds critical bugs?"

**Answer**: That's WHY you're doing the audit. Better to find now than on mainnet. Then:
1. Fix the bugs
2. Re-test
3. Get auditor sign-off
4. Deploy to mainnet with confidence

### Question: "Can I skip the audit?"

**Answer**: No. Absolutely not. Here's why:
- No institutional support without audit
- No community confidence without audit
- No mainnet deployment without audit
- Security is non-negotiable

Audit is the bottleneck. But it's the RIGHT bottleneck.
